> The storming of the United States Capitol was a riot and violent attack against the 117th United States Congress on January 6, 2021, carried out by a mob of supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump in an attempt to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. After attending a Trump rally, thousands of his supporters marched down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, where a joint session of Congress was beginning the Electoral College vote count. These rioters occupied, vandalized, and looted parts of the building for several hours. The riot led to the evacuation and lockdown of the Capitol, and five deaths.
